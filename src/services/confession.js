          I thank you that by Christ’s stripes I am healed. I do not live by what I see and I act in faith. I refuse every symptom caused by sickness in Jesus name. Praise the name of the Lord. Jesus, I love you. Thank for healing me and protecting my health. 
          I refuse any sickness or pain in my body. Such things can no longer stay in my body. I am full of God’s life and power. By the divine health God gives me I live a long and healthy life.

          I will not use the indescribable abundance he gives me only for myself; I will use them as tools to expand the kingdom of God and to express love to my neighbors. 
          I will train myself in the principle of sowing and reaping that I may receive a greater blessing with greater faith, that I may be a blessing to others.

          He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
          Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
          Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
          A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.
          Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
          Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;
          There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
          For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
          They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
          Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
          Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
          He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
          With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.`

            content: `There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
          For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
          For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
          That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
          For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
          For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.
          Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
          So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
          But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
          And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
          But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
          Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
          For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
          For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
          For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
          The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:
          And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
          For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
          For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
          For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,
          Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
          For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
          And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.
          For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
          But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.
          Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
          And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.
          And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.
          For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
          Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
          What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?
          He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
          Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.
          Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
          Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
          As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
          Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
          For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
          Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

          For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.
          And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.
          Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.
          Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee.
          The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall shew forth the praises of the Lord.
          All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.
          Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?
          Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the Lord thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.
          And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee.
          Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought.
          For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.
          The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
          The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee; The city of the Lord, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
          Whereas thou has been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.
          Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.
          For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness.
          Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.
          The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.
          Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.
          Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.
          A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the Lord will hasten it in his time.
